# Social-Media-Platform

In this project, I provided a platform to the users from where they can create their account, set their own profile with username and profile picture and then they can view the pictures/posts of other users who are using this platform and be able to like their pictures/posts but for that first they have to follow that user. Like count given below the post will show us the exact like counts, user can download that post also. On the users profile they can see their all uploaded posts, their total followers and their following count. On home page User also be able to see the suggestions of the profiles which user not following. User can also upload their own pictures/posts with caption from the home page. User also can search for the particular profile of an existing user.
